This program was designed as a learning experiment to help me understand
better how PeopleSoft stored PeopleCode.  The only table that it INSERTs into
or DELETEs from is DLP_PCODE (which it will create if not found).

TO DO / KNOWN ISSUES:
 * There are still only a very little bit of indenting logic.  Mostly just
   playing around trying to find out what works.  Most likely it needs to be
   removed and a new approach used.
 * There are still several instances where line feeds aren't correct.  Such
   as where semi-colons are options (single statement 'if' blocks)
 * Spacing is fairly good.  Semi-colons sometimes get an extra space before them.
